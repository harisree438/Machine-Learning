# Machine-Learning
How can we build and compare multiple classification models to predict a target variable, evaluate their performance, and assess their robustness using cross-validation?


We implemented three popular classification algorithms:
Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
